# dominoeProblem

The task is to develop simple console java application that finds longest chain of tiles from the dominoes game.
The tiles of standard dominoes game set are shuffled then N (user input) of them randomly selected for the chaining.
Connections of the dominoes are "standard" (point-to-point, according common game rules). Some of the tiles of N-set may be out of chain if they have no connection.
The output of the application - the longest chain and optionally list of out-of-chain tiles.
